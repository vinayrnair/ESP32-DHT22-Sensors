# Introduction
After learning about how to connect Raspberry Pi and ESP32 via MQTT, I stumbled upon another very interesting Github user @DaveSprague who connected the ESP8266 directly to Adafruit IO. This is interesting as it frees my Raspberry Pi for other interesting projects. So I decided this is the way to go. 

# Problem statement
At this point of time it will be worth noting the "real" purpose of this project. I live in Germany where the weather is brutally dry for an Indian like me. My daughter has dry skin problems which got me thinking to start monitorinng the humidity in our house. I found that at times, the humidity can reach well below 30%. According to a quick google research, the average indoor humidity, comfortable for humans, should be between 30%-60%. This is not good and I decided to buy a humidifier for her room. 

The problem with humidifier is that we cant monitor how much is the humidity and or the impact of humidifier after its switched on. 
For this I decided to build this very simple project. 

# Disclaimer
The code is taken directly from @DaveSprague with very few modification. So a special thanks for Dave for providingn the code and explanation on his Github page:
