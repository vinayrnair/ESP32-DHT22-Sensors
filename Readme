This Repo is for my project to learn about MQTT protocol, use Raspberry Pi and ESP32 chip 
to transmit, wirelessly, humidity and temp sensor from DHT22.

The end game is to control my humidifier based on humidity values, for which I am currently thinking of 
using IFTT and a smart electric plug to which the humidifier will be connected.

The project is heavily influenced by the steps shared by rotoron in his website:
